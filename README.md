Modeling a Hopfield Network for Pattern Storage and Retrieval

## Abstract
This project implements a Hopfield network to model associative memory for binary pattern storage and retrieval. The network's performance is evaluated through stability tests, noise robustness experiments, and capacity analysis. Results confirm the network's ability to retrieve stored patterns from noisy inputs but highlight limitations in storage capacity, aligning with theoretical predictions.
